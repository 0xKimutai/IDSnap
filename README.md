# IDSnap - ID Card Scanner App

A comprehensive React Native application for scanning and extracting data from ID cards using advanced OCR technology.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Advanced OCR Processing**: Extract text from ID cards with high accuracy
- **Multiple ID Card Support**: Generic ID cards, driver's licenses, passports, and more
- **Image Enhancement**: Automatic image preprocessing for better OCR results
- **Data Validation**: Intelligent validation and error checking of extracted data
- **Export Options**: Save results in JSON, CSV, or print directly
- **Scan History**: Keep track of all your scanned documents
- **Offline Processing**: All OCR processing happens locally on your device
- **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with Material Design components

## ðŸ“± App Overview

The app includes four main screens:
- **Home Screen**: Welcome screen with quick stats and features overview
- **Camera Screen**: Camera interface with ID card frame guide
- **Preview Screen**: Review captured image before processing
- **Result Screen**: Display extracted data with editing capabilities

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

This is a **demo version** with a complete UI implementation. The Metro bundler is running successfully, and you can navigate through all screens. Current limitations:
- Camera functionality is simulated (shows placeholder UI)
- OCR processing returns mock data for demonstration
- Export features show alerts instead of actual functionality

The complete architecture and UI are implemented, ready for integration with actual OCR libraries.

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes â€”Â this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
